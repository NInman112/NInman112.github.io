The concept of this web app was to utilize the Yelp API and allow a user to search for restaurants in a specified area.

The Yelp API is quite dynamic but simple to get going, once you know how to get it up and running.  The search criteria for finding a restaurant can handle quite a few different variations of foods and locations.  I did find it was not specific to restaurants since Yelp does handle all sorts of businesses.

One resource I found quite helpful for figuring out how to get the Yelp API working was from another Flatiron Students blog.

Morganne breaks down the process of adding the API to an existing rails application and makes it all makes sense.  The GitHub page for the Yelp Fusion API isn't too helpful and Yelp's site doesn't exactly break down the requirements for getting it working with Rails.  Once I got the API working within my app, it was as easy as scraping, actually quite a bit easier.

Throughout the process of building this web app I focused on functionality and making everything work as it was being built.  Once logins were working, I then focused on making sure users could only access their info.  Breaking the whole process down into smaller portions makes the entire process a bit easier to handle.

I did run into a few issues near the end since I added some additional features and dried up the code a bit without testing everything and managed to break quite a few things.  I hadn't pushed to GitHub in a while and didn't know what progress I would lose if I rolled back.  

Each project has taught me something new, not just in terms of writing out code but also the design process and making sure that every change that happens to the project needs to be tested completely throughout the app, not just a few features.  Logging in, logging out, new users, new database, everything….  It doesn’t take much to cause a ripple in the entire app.
