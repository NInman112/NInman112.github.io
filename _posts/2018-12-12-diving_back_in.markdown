Switching careers feels like you are attempting to do a U-turn, on the freeway, with traffic, while going 70mph.  It just isn’t meant to be a smooth transition.  I finished up my Bachelors in Information Technology over a year ago and then moved to Seattle, Washington in pursuit of an IT type of job.  My degree did teach me a great deal about the inner workings of software development, it failed to teach me what I really wanted to focus on, which happens to be coding.  Over a year later I am diving back in and am pretty excited about the prospects, even just after two weeks.

I was at my last job for 10 years, I was content, made decent money, but I couldn’t see a future with it.  It was a physically demanding job and not easy on anything, the reason I could make the money I did was because I was still young.  The older I would get, the harder the job would become and the slower I would perform, which means less money since we were commission based(we were paid for the hours we turned, not clocked in hours).  I want a secure job that has advancement opportunities, deals with innovative tech, and it is always looking to improve and expand.  Looking at where I was, it just didn’t make sense, my job had hit a dead-end and I started to wonder what was I doing and could I see myself doing this for the next “x” amount of years…. That was a nope.

I enjoy trying to figure out how things work and why they do what they do.  There is never really a time when that stops, everything that I see I question why it was made that way, or how could I go about recreating it.  I can be the annoying person that asks why and will actually want to know why, not just because someone told you so.

This is why I am pursing coding, not just for a better future, but to create things that could possibly become something much greater.
