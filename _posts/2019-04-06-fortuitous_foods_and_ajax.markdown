I was aware that upcoming events in my life would cause a bit of disturbance, little did I know how much of a distraction it all really could be!   I was expecting my first child to be due yesterday, April 5th, but he arrived two weeks early on the 22nd of March!  Needless to say the past two weeks have been a challenge and adding AJAX to my existing rails project was quite the challenge.  

There was a point when I wanted to just rebuild the entire app since I thought it would be easier, but I knew that was probably not the case.  I needed to focus and get something to work, every time I tried to get something to work regarding JS or AJAX, it would error.  This was about two days, two days of some crazy mad frustration along with a newborn attempting to cover the world (or our house) in pee.  I would like to blame my lack of sleep and a newborn on this mistake...  I will try.

AJAX would throw an error about something not being a function.  This would happen no matter what route I took to fix it, until I googled the error (after two days of fighting it).  This app was my last project and even though JS wasn't required, I added a tiny bit of it.  That JS I added was a light, or thin, version that did not include AJAX...  This cost me two days and it was a single line of code, really, I think it was almost a single word that was included in my JS file path on my application main page.

Once that was solved things started taking off, implementing somethings certain were harder, while some I didn't even realize they did work since they fit in flawlessly, the serializers being one of those.  Being able to reduce the amount of page refreshes makes the app seem totally different, eventually it would be great to try and make a web app that only displays on a single page, or convert this one to that, I just don't know if that actually is a thing, it sounds like an interesting idea..
