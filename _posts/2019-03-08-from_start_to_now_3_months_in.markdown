Five months sounds like a long time.  It's just about half a year, it's half the time to develop a baby, it's also almost an entire school year.  There could be any number of things that could happen in the span of half a year, it isn't a very long time and flies on by at incredible speeds...  My full time cohort has just reached a bit over three months in and I am not sure where the time went.  Some say time flies when you're having fun but this is on a different level.  Yes, I am enjoying myself, yes I am having fun, but at the same time its work and it is flying by and sometimes it feels like its flying past me. 

Really though, is it less like a feeling and more like did I decide to take on more than I should have?  A lot can happen in a few months, and the first month is a blur.  The first week was like taking the bunny hill while skiing, or just jumping into the super shallow end of the pool..  Yes you can touch and wade and do things that seem like you know what your are doing, but that changes rapidly.

That nice bunny hill you've been on is now going from a five degree slope to a twenty degree slope and there isn't a change in sight, it's only getting steeper.  Some will have to bail just because the speed is too much, not because they aren't capable.

Fortunately Rails is quite amazing and everything starts to tie all together.  All of the previous things we have learned was to build up to Rails so we know what is going on behind the scenes.  There is so much that happens with Rails and knowing how it all joins up and makes all of that "magic" happen, automagically....
