Our cohort is entering the final couple of weeks before we finish up this five month journey!  It seems like we just started but it also feels like it’s been a decade, I can't decide which it is.  The amount of material we have covered in the last sixteen weeks is quite crazy.  The first four weeks were dedicated to basic Ruby, learning about Object-Orientated programming, and getting the basics down.  Each week built upon the last, until we reach a final project for that section.  Each section also built upon the previous section, so our second block of courses exposed us to Sinatra, which basically took everything we previously learned and wrapped it up into an awesome Ruby Gem that does so much for you.  We got to know Active Record and the amazing things it does for our code, as well as keeping our code smell down to a minimum.


Things really started snowballing when Rails was added, much of what we had learned was everything that Rails does in the background, or 'automagically'.  That doesn't mean anything got easier, the assignments became more involved and sometimes a little bit vague on what they were looking for, but I suppose that is the goal.  I can't image we will always have a pre-built test to aid us in figuring out the best way to program something.  Once we finished up our Rails projects we got introduced to JavaScript, which makes performing some actions with Rails quite simple.  


This only gets compounded when we move into React and start to see how capable it is at creating single page web applications.  I actually can’t wait to dive even further into React and see what kind of things we can create with it.  It was created by a software engineer at Facebook and is currently maintained by Facebook.  Single page web apps are certainly the trend, over half of web traffic is generated from mobile devices.  Three years ago that number was about 35%, and three before that it was a little over 10%.  90% of the time people spend on their phones is within apps and React allows us to create websites that will provide the user with that single page, seamless app experience.
