Sometimes the biggest challenge with the start of the project is figuring out what the project will be...  A few ideas might come on by but when they get put down on a whiteboard or piece of paper, they seem to just fall apart, the depth might not be there, maybe there isn't enough data readily available to create such a project, or simply the idea is too complicated to start.

The start of this one was too complicated, everything sounded like a great idea but when the coding started, it was quickly realized that this is going to get more complicated then it should be.  Not only was it getting too complicated, but squirreling on less important features was a habit that quickly developed.  

About a day in, the project was barebones with very limited functionality, the user could signup, but logins acted funny, there could be users with the same username, and passwords weren't encrypted.  A good deal of time was spent trying to make elements look acceptable instead of actually focusing on the important part and getting the main functions working 100%.

Once the correct focus was found, which didn’t include styling the web application, things started to move much faster and smoother.  Logins were revamped, encrypted passwords were added, usernames were not allowed to be duplicated and users could only add, edit, and delete items that were theirs.  The project started flying right along when the focus was corrected.

Going forward, building the proper functionality and focusing on the main features of the application should come before trying to make it aesthetically pleasing, which still fell behind a bit since so much time was spent doing that instead of building out required features.


Remember…. Focus on the main features…  Remembered hopefully for next time..
